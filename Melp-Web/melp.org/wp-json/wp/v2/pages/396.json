MELCODER. It was utilized by the NATO&#8217;s test-laboratory as a part of the MELPe standardization process. Its software conformed with all the MELPe standard&#8217;s requirements. MELCODER provided real-time implementation of MELPe, panel mount user&#8217;s control for selecting the different MELPe features, and LED indications for real-time MELPe status monitoring. It included audio IO, and serial link for compressed bitstream IO. It can be connected to any testing device, or field channel for real-time testing of the MELPe vocoder under various conditions. The MELCODER was used by the NATO&#8217;s test laboratory that evaluated the MELPe and confirmed its performance under numerous conditions.<\/p>\n\n<i><b>Figure 1.a<\/b> Compandent&#8217;s <b>MELCODER<\/b> (front) The MELPe &#8220;Gold standard&#8221; reference hardware for STANAG-4591.
