Our package was mostly written and optimized in Assembly language for different DSPs, it is C callable (far call) and self initialized. It includes main C programs for processing files and for real-time demo, comprehensive manual, the &#8220;certified&#8221; Test Vectors, Compandent&#8217;s professional support (provided by the same world-class DSP and speech coding experts who participated in creating the MELPe standard), etc.. We also offer Compandent&#8217;s MELPe suite for other platforms such as <a href=\"https:\/\/melpe.org\/pdf\/MELPePackageFactSheetPOSIX.pdf\">Windows, Unix, Linux, MacOS<\/a> etc..\n<b> <a name=\"Q01.4\"><\/a>1.4 Q: On what processors or platforms does your MELPe suite run?<\/b><br \/>\nA: We have ported the MELPe to various processors and platforms including Texas Instruments&#8217; TMS320c54xx, TMS320c55xx, TMS320c64xx, C64x+ (such as C674x C672x etc.), and OMAP (c55x based, c64x+ based etc..), Analog Devices BlackFin ADSP-BF561 and TigerSharc (TS101, TS20x, etc.), <a href=\"https:\/\/www.microchip.com\/design-centers\/wireless-connectivity\/embedded-wi-fi\/pic32mz-w1f\">Microchip PIC32MZ<\/a>, <a href=\"\/mobileapp\/\">ARM, Android, iOS<\/a>, GHS PowerPC <a href=\"\/pdf\/MELPePackageFactSheetPOSIX.pdf\">Windows, Unix, Linux and Apple\u00a0 MacOS<\/a>.

We can port it to any needed platform.\n\n<h3><a name=\"Q02\"><\/a>2. COMPANDENT AND THE MELPe STANDARD<\/h3>\n<b> <a name=\"Q02.1\"><\/a>2.1 Q: Why does Compandent&#8217;s MELPe sound better than the standard reference?<\/b><br \/>\nA. Compandent has been working on the MELPe package for many years now (since 2001). We have extensively tested our MELPe suite (a.k.a <strong>MELPe++<\/strong> or <strong>MELPe-Plus-Plus<\/strong>) in many different environments and with a variety of speech data. We can show you examples where the standard reference produces hoarse speech or annoying clicks while Compandent&#8217;s MELPe (MELPe++) produces much better sounding and cleaner speech. We thoroughly investigated any sign of a problem or bug and didn&#8217;t give up until we resolved it in the best possible way, in order to make sure that our customers get the best sounding implementation! In fact, even combining Compandent&#8217;s MELPe++ in a system that already uses MELP or MELPe on the other end is likely to improve quality on both ends! (compared to MELP or MELPe standard reference on both ends)\n<b> <a name=\"Q02.2\"><\/a>2.2 Q: How can I listen to Compandent&#8217;s real-time MELPe vocoder?<\/b><br \/>\nA: Our package includes a main C program that runs the MELPe in real-time. You may run it, listen to it in real time, and even switch its configurations on the fly without reloading it.\n<b> <a name=\"Q02.3\"><\/a>2.3 Q: Who created the standard Test Vectors, and is your MELPe suite Test Vectors &#8220;certified&#8221;? <\/b><br \/>\nA: Excellent question! Compandent has contributed to the MELPe standard reference, and kept doing subsequent MELPe-related project for the US DoD. In fact, <b>Compandent has created the standard reference&#8217;s &#8220;certified&#8221; Test Vectors<\/b>. Throughout our work over the years, we extensively improved and tested our MELPe implementation using additional data bases that are very relevant to the MELPe customers and applications.\n<b> <a name=\"Q02.4\"><\/a>2.4 Q: How can I verify the Test vectors?<\/b><br \/>\nA: Our package includes a main C program that processes Test Vector files. You may run it and then compare its output to the provided reference Test Vectors.\n\n<h3 align=\"left\"><a name=\"Q03\"><\/a>3. COMPANDENT&#8217;S BUSINESS TERMS AND BENEFITS<\/h3>\n<b> <a name=\"Q03.1\"><\/a>3.1 Q: What guarantee or warranty do you offer your customers?<\/b><br \/>\nA: We provide a 30 day money back guarantee that our MELPe performs according to our specifications, namely that it passes the Test Vectors, and meets the specified memory and MIPS requirements.\n<b> <a name=\"Q03.2\"><\/a>3.2 Q: Do you charge for software updates and bug fixes?<\/b><br \/>\nA: No! We want our customers to have the best implementation. When a bug fix or update is made, we provide it to our customers without charge for the lifetime of the product!\n<b> <a name=\"Q03.3\"><\/a>3.3 Q: Do you charge for technical support?<\/b><br \/>\nA: Normally not. We provide free support to our customers for a reasonable period that is more than sufficient for them to successfully integrate our MELPe suite into their product.\n\n<h3 align=\"left\"><a name=\"Q04\"><\/a>4. WORKING WITH COMPANDENT&#8217;S MELPe PACKAGE<\/h3>\n<b> <a name=\"Q04.1\"><\/a>4.1 Q: Do I need to reload the MELPe program every time the program is restarted or vocoder mode is changed?<\/b><br \/>\nA: No, you may simply re-run it and it initializes itself without a need to be reloaded.\n<b> <a name=\"Q04.2\"><\/a>4.2 Q: What is the compressed bit format of the MELPe vocoder?<\/b><br \/>\nA: Included with Compandent&#8217;s MELPe suite is a detailed manual that explains the MELPe compressed bit format.\n<b> <a name=\"Q04.3\"><\/a>4.3 Q: Can we operate the 2400 bps MELPe without using the 1200 bps (or 600 bps) one?<\/b><br \/>\nA: Yes, in fact you may save much memory and MIPS by using the 2400 bps only.\n<b> <a name=\"Q04.4\"><\/a>4.4 Q: Can we use the 1200 bps (or 600 bps) MELPe without the 2400 bps one?<\/b><br \/>\nA: Yes, but your savings may be negligible if any, since the 1200 bps (or 600 bps) vocoder is a superset of the 2400 bps and is based on it anyway.\n<b> <a name=\"Q04.5\"><\/a>4.5 Q: Can we use the MELPe vocoder without the noise preprocessor?<\/b><br \/>\nA: Yes, and by doing so one may save some memory, MIPS and may need to license less IPR.\n\n<h3 align=\"left\"><a name=\"Q05\"><\/a>5. MELPe VS. MELP<\/h3>\n<b> <a name=\"Q05.1\"><\/a>5.1 Q: Does MELPe sound better than MELP?<\/b><br \/>\nA: Yes, the 2400 bps MELPe sounds better than the MELP. Furthermore, Compandent&#8217;s MELPe suite (a.k.a <strong>MELPe++<\/strong> or <strong>MELPe-Plus-Plus<\/strong>) sounds even better, since over the past years we have fixed numerous bugs and issues in MELPe, some of which even originated from the old MELP. We can show you examples where the MELP and MELPe standard reference produces hoarse speech or annoying clicks while Compandent&#8217;s MELPe (MELPe++) produces much better sounding and cleaner speech.\n<b> <a name=\"Q05.2\"><\/a>5.2 Q: Should I use MELP rather than MELPe for legacy compatibility considerations?<\/b><br \/>\nA: At 2400 bps the MELPe and MELP uses a similar bit format, therefore a MELPe synthesizer would produce better quality speech than the MELP synthesizer for the same bit-stream. In other words, even if you communicate with a MELP based legacy device, you will improve the speech quality by utilizing a MELPe based new device on your end. So we would certainly recommend using MELPe rather than MELP. Furthermore, combining Compandent&#8217;s MELPe++ in a system that already uses MELP (or even MELPe standard reference) on the other end is likely to improve quality on both ends! (compared to MELP or MELPe standard reference on both ends)\n<b> <a name=\"Q05.3\"><\/a>5.3 Q: Does MELPe have higher delay than MELP? and What is the MELPe delay?<\/b><br \/>\nA: At 2400 bps both MELPe and MELP have the same delay. The encoder (algorithmic) delay of MELPe is 42.625ms, 103.75ms and 126.25ms for the 2400, 1200 and 600 bps MELPe, respectively. The total end-to-end delay depends on how one computes it, and that may vary among different networks having different packet size and different delay, buffering, and processing. We can explain to you how the US DoD and NATO typically compute the MELP &amp; MELPe delay in their networks, and how you may compute the end-to-end MELPe delay in your network. Included with Compandent&#8217;s MELPe suite is a detailed manual that explains the MELP &amp; MELPe delay. For more information please call us or <a href=\"https:\/\/melp.org\/contact\/\">contact us<\/a>.\n<b> <a name=\"Q05.4\"><\/a>5.4 The old MELP is known as MIL-STD-3005, what MIL-STD number is MELPe?<\/b><br \/>\nA: Both <a href=\"https:\/\/melp.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/02\/MIL-STD-3005-MELP.pdf\">MELP<\/a> and MELPe are known as <a href=\"https:\/\/melp.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/02\/MIL-STD-3005-MELP.pdf\">MIL-STD-3005<\/a>. The <a href=\"https:\/\/melp.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/02\/MIL-STD-3005-MELP.pdf\">MIL-STD-3005<\/a> is their US DoD standard number. The MELPe is a newer and enhanced version of MIL-STD-3005. So if your project includes specifications for <a href=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/02\/MIL-STD-3005-MELP.pdf\">MIL-STD-3005<\/a> that were written after the year 2001, they most likely refer to the MELPe rather than to the old MELP. The MELPe is also known as STANAG 4591, which is its NATO standard number. For more information please call us or <a href=\"https:\/\/melp.org\/contact\/\">contact us<\/a>.\n<b> <a name=\"Q05.5\"><\/a>5.5 Does MELPe require a lot more memory and MIPS than the old MELP?<\/b><br \/>\nA: Not necessarily, that depends on what we are comparing. At 2400 bps both MELPe and <a href=\"https:\/\/melp.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/02\/MIL-STD-3005-MELP.pdf\">MELP<\/a> require similar memory and MIPS, so if you are required to use 2400 bps vocoder, then you would only benefit by using MELPe rather than the old MELP. The lower rates MELPe require similar amount of MIPS, but more memory (mainly ROM tables) than the 2400 bps. The MELPe&#8217;s optional Noise-PreProcessing (NPP) may also add to the required memory and MIPS. For more information please see our <a href=\"https:\/\/melpe.org\/pdf\/MELPePackageFactSheet.pdf\"> factsheet<\/a> or call us or <a href=\"https:\/\/melp.org\/contact\/\">contact us<\/a>.\n\n<h3 align=\"left\"><a name=\"Q06\"><\/a>6. MELPe and MELP vs. other vocoders<\/h3>\n<b> <a name=\"Q06.1\"><\/a>6.1 Q: Are MELPe and MELP better than other vocoders such as AMBE, EMBE, STC, SBC and FSHC??<\/b><br \/>\nA: Yes, in 1996 <a href=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/02\/MIL-STD-3005-MELP.pdf\">MELP<\/a> won the US DoD <a href=\"https:\/\/melp.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/02\/MIL-STD-3005-MELP.pdf\">MIL-STD-3005<\/a> standard competition against other candidate vocoders such as (a) Frequency Selective Harmonic Coder (FSHC), (b) Advanced Multiband Excitation (AMBE), (c) Enhanced Multiband Excitation (EMBE), (d) Sinusoid Transform Coder (STC), and (e) Subband LPC Coder (SBC). Under the US DoD&#8217;s extensive testing MELP received the highest score and was eventually selected as the standard. Several years later, the enhanced-MELP (MELPe) was developed and even surpassed the MELP&#8217;s quality. Hence at bitrates of 2400, 1200, and 600, MELPe is the best vocoder available in real-time DSP implementation.\n<b> <a name=\"Q06.2\"><\/a>6.2 Q: Is MELPe better than the old secure voice standards such as FS1015 LPC-10e (2.4 kbps), FS1016 CELP (4.8 kbps) and CVSD (16 kbps)?<\/b><br \/>\nA: Yes, in 2002 as part of NATO testing for new NATO standard, MELPe was tested against other candidates such as France&#8217;s HSX (Harmonic Stochastic eXcitation) and Turkey&#8217;s SB-LPC (Split-Band Linear Predictive Coding), as well as the old secure voice standards such as FS1015 LPC-10e (2.4 kbps), FS1016 CELP (4.8 kbps) and CVSD (16 kbps). Subsequently, the MELPe won also the NATO competition, surpassing the quality of all other candidates as well as the quality of all old secure voice standards (CVSD, CELP and LPC-10e). The NATO competition concluded that MELPe substantially improved performance (in terms of speech quality, intelligibility, and noise immunity), while reducing throughput requirements. The NATO testing also included interoperability tests, used over 200 hours of speech data, and was conducted by 3 test laboratories world wide.\n\n\n\n<h3 align=\"left\"><a name=\"Q07\"><\/a>7. THE REQUIRED SW\/HW ENVIRONMENT FOR COMPANDENT&#8217;S MELPe<\/h3>\n<b> <a name=\"Q07.1\"><\/a>7.1 Q: What operating system, kernel, RTOS environment or host PC is needed to run your MELPe suite?<\/b><br \/>\nA: None! Our suite does not require and is not limited to any kernel or other specific environment, and does not consume precious memory for such. It uses C callable (far call) or Assembly callable functions, and you may simply and easily integrate it to any program or environment. As a part of our suite we provide example of main C programs that runs the MELPe vocoder, which you may use as guidelines for your application and its integration.\n<b> <a name=\"Q07.2\"><\/a>7.2 Q: In order for you to provide support for example, do you require Companden&#8217;s MELPe customers to purchase additional (potentially expensive) &#8220;peripheral&#8221; software, HPI, interface with other software such as Matlab, HyperSignal etc.?<\/b><br \/>\nA: No we do not play such games! We do not waste our customers&#8217; time and money on such unnecessary &#8220;peripheral&#8221; software or GUI, that is not much useful for and is commonly irrelevant to the customer&#8217;s actual product. One may choose to use such and we can provide such, but we don&#8217;t suggest that as necessary. We provide our customers with a complete and robust and yet the most concise and efficient suite that contains all they <b>really need<\/b>, in order to allow them the fastest and easiest integration in moving forward with their product development, saving them development cost, and minimizing their time-to market!\n<b> <a name=\"Q07.3\"><\/a>7.3 Q: Does Compandent&#8217;s MELPe package run under TI&#8217;s Code Composer Studio (CCS)?<\/b><br \/>\nA: Yes, of course. Our suite is CCS ready, and we provide all the necessary GEL and project files. You may compile, load, run, and profile it under CCS. You may even process files or run it in real-time under CCS.\n<b> <a name=\"Q07.4\"><\/a>7.4 Q: What specific system or hardware is required to run Compandent&#8217;s MELPe suite?<\/b><br \/>\nA: No specific hardware is needed.

DSP AND DEVELOPMENT BOARD FOR COMPANDENT&#8217;S MELPe<\/h3>\n<b> <a name=\"Q08.1\"><\/a>8.1 Q: Which DSP would you recommend for MELPe, TMS320c54xx or TMS320c55xx?<\/b><br \/>\nA: You may use either one (or another DSP of your choice). Some use the TMS320c54xx for legacy considerations. (The TMS320c5416 is very popular). But for future considerations, we recommend using the TMS320c55xx, since the TMS320c55xx provides some advantages such as larger and more flexible memory space (which is particularly important if you use the complete MELPe suite and your product uses lots of additional Data RAM). The TMS320c55xx is even cheaper than the TMS320c54xx since TI is interested in advancing its adoption. Compandent offers its MELPe suite also for the TI&#8217;s TMS320c64xx DSP, as well as Analog Devices BlackFin ADSP-BF561 and TigerSharc (TS101, TS20x, etc.), <a href=\" https:\/\/www.microchip.com\/design-centers\/wireless-connectivity\/embedded-wi-fi\/pic32mz-w1\">Microchip PIC32MZ<\/a>, <a href=\"\/mobileapp\/\">ARM, Android, Apple iOS<\/a>, and GHS PowerPC.\n<b> <a name=\"Q08.2\"><\/a>8.2 Q: Would you recommend any specific DSP development board?<\/b><br \/>\nA: For DSP implementation we suggest using TI\/Spectrum Digital&#8217;s DSKs, which are really nice and reliable packages that include an easy to install development board, TI&#8217;s Code Composer Studio (CCS), USB port, A\/D\/A converters, LEDs, DIP switches, and expansion headers for various purposes and\/or daughter-cards such as Ethernet port, USB, RS232, RS422, parallel port, external codecs and many more.
